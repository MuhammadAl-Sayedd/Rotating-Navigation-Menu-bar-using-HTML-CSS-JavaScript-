        <h1>Lions</h1>

        <p>
          The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
          Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short,
          rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It
          is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
          have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
          prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
          and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
          on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
          although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been
          known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out
          and prey on humans. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and
          shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
          persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During
          the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast
          Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been
          reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one
          population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the
          IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
          declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
          untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of
          the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
          humans are the greatest causes for concern. One of the most widely
          recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been
          extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags,
          and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in
          menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key
          species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world
          since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were
          prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually
          all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current
          range.

          The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head,
          a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light
          buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the
          underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots,
          which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often
          may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only
          member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism.
          Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and
          backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The
          mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black
          hairs.The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that
          in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard
          "spine" or "spur" that is formed from the final, fused sections of
          tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent
          at birth and develops at around 5+1‚ÅÑ2 months of age. It is readily
          identifiable by the age of seven months.Of the living felid
          species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and
          height at the shoulder.Its skull is very similar to that of the
          tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and
          flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader
          nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull
          variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower
          jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.Skeletal
          muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents
          the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.
